In [[the-history-of-sexuality]], [[Michel Foucault|foucault]] criticizes the [[repressive-hypothesis]], or the belief that conversation around human sexuality was sharply limited from the 17th century to the mid-20th century because of the rise of the bourgeoisie. Instead, he advanced the hypothesis that that period took an *increasing* interest in sexuality, but tended to medicalize it.
