Holy opportunism is a personal coinage for a phenomenon I observe where ideology and personal interest tend to mutually reinforce one another, and where a person can be both a genuine believer in the core tenets of their system while having that system's tenets transform to match one's interests.

This may just be an overly complex formation of the term ideology; I'm not sure. What I know is that I observe many politicians and thinkers who seem to be both genuine believers in their ideology ([[Hillary Clinton's|people.hillary-clinton]] emails are not at all what you would expect if she dropped her guard immediately behind closed doors, for instance) and yet are incredibly cynical — [[people.LBJ]], for instance, is an infamous example of this, and [[Caro's book|books.caro.passage-of-power]] demonstrates him to be both a cynical individual and a genuine believer in civil rights. Why? How wonderful it is when self-interest (see: the voting pattern of African-Americans) tends to coincide with what is morally righteous!

Moldbug has a formulation of this in saying that [[lit.yarvin.progressivism-kick-enemies-feel-good]], and liberals aren't alone in that regard ([[e.ideology-allows-enjoying-causing-pain-enemies]]).
