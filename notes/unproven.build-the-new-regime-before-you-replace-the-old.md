Yarvin references successful _coups d'Ã©tat_ such as the one in Russia in 1991 where the revolution was quick, bloodless, and pain-free (obviously, the last is not true for Russia, but the violence was extremely low by the standards of Russian history) in formulating a general principle: that successful revolutionaries build a replacement regime, effectively in exile, to replace the old one upon seizure of power.

I can think of several regimes that would have done better had they actually had a more permanent conception of what they wanted to do in place upon seizing power: the Bolsheviks, who essentially had no economic plan.
