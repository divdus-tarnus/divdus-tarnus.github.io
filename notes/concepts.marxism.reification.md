Reification, to [[people.georgy-lukacs]] and other Western Marxists, is a special kind of [[concepts.marxism.alienation]] in which social relations are perceived as inherent attributes of people, and where both subject and object's roles are replaced and interchangeable.

To Lukacs, the [[concepts.marxism.commodity-form]] serves as the basis for all capitalist objectivity, and tends to reduce qualitative distinctions between people and things into quantitative categories

%%the de-historicization and political neutralization of the social relations that constitute the social system and the dominant forms of consciousness%%
