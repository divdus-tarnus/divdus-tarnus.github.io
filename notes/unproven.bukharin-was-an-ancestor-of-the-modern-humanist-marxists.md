Bukharin's reforms and general attitude were remarkably similar to those of the reformists, and to those of the modern Marxist humanists. In my view, this is both a strength and a weakness; his humane policies would have been wiser in another age, and in fact, I think it likely he would have been a better ruler than Stalin in spite of the comparative slowness of the NEP to Stalin's collectivization, but given the exact circumstances that Stalin faced after Hitler's election, Bukharin would have been a weaker choice.
