Jahiliyya is an Islamic term meaning "ignorance".

In its original context, jahiliyya was used by Muslims referred to the state of paganism the Arabs lived in prior to Islam; in modernity, it tends to refer either to the essentially pagan nature of modern Western culture and its effects on Islamic countries, or to Islamists, the submission of men to one another rather than to God in sharia law.
