Empiriomonism was [[Alexander Bogdanov's|people.bogdanov]] development of dialectical and historical materialism in light of developments in social and physical sciences, (the *Ding an sich* does not truly exist, only the sensations and sensory complexes of the brain).

Bogdanov believed that collective social labor established causal relationships through *substitution*, in which people imagine their own models of how the world works based on their own labor as universally valid examples — in essence, to a hammer, everything looks like a nail — which necessitates some universal code to translate between these mental models (Bogdanov's [[concepts.tektology]]).
