A *stochastic process* is a model that describes a system with random elements changing over time (specifically with uncertainties or complexities *not captured by the initial state of the system*). Stochastic processes are specifically not deterministic. Complex systems are often modeled using these specifically because it makes analysis much easier at a certain scale and number of variables.
