Ijtihad is making legal decisions by independent interpretation of the Qur'an and Sunnah.

Most Sunni scholars agreed that the gateway to new ijtihad was closed during the 800s, but interestingly, senior jurists in Shi'a Islam still perform this, and there have been Sunni scholars who have called for a revival of this. This seems to parallel the dichotomy in many other religions (Reform, Conservative, and Modern Orthodox Judaism against traditionalist/Orthodox Judaism, post-Vatican II Catholicism versus traditionalism).
