Managerialism is [[James Burnham's|people.burnham]] term to refer to the form of government adopted in the early 1900s by the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, and the USA (to a lesser extent), replacing both capitalism and Lenin's attempt at socialism. To Burnham, each country had created a bureaucratic, technocratic class that was increasingly taking over the economy and displacing the previous ruling elite.

This formulation, to Burnham, explains the tendencies of each nation better than their nominal form. While each of these nations maintained a public visage of ideological support for what preceded it, the actual practice in each case tended to be remarkably similar â€” the [[concepts.ussr.nomenklatura]] in the USSR, the rule of the Party in Nazi Germany, and the [[concepts.usa.brain-trust]] in the United States.
