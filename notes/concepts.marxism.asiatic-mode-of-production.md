The Asiatic mode of production was a controversial theory of Marx's, stating that many Asiatic societies (notably India and China) were largely based in despotic expropriation of [[concepts.marxism.surplus-value]]; true private ownership was absent, and there was little to no commodity production, exchange, or even *historical change* in these societies.
