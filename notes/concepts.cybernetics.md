*(Disclaimer: I am still very new to cybernetic thought, and as such, this description will necessarily be subject to change as I learn more.)*

Cybernetics is essentially the study of government in motion — it is, by its own thinking, to political science as calculus is to algebra, or the dialectic to formal logic. The essential aspect that distinguishes cybernetic thought from other political thought is understanding how feedback, variety, and *change* affect the capacity of a system of governance to be able to regulate itself.

From its Greek root, κυβερνητική, cybernetics literally means the art of governance or steermanship, and cyberneticist thinkers such as Norbert Wiener and Stafford Beer tend to provide naïve explanations in that terminology. What seems to distinguish it from traditional political thinking (say, the liberalism of [[montesquieu]], de Maistre's monarchism, or Lenin's vanguardism) is its emphasis upon self-regulating but essentially monistic systems. Humans are, simultaneously, individual beings within it and mere synapses of a greater functioning brain, influencing and shaping the greater whole. In a sense, it's a highly Hegelian way of looking at the problem of government.
