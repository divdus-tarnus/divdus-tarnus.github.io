A celebration parallax is when you're not allowed to acknowledge that a phenomenon exists when criticizing it, but when you *are* allowed to acknowledge it when you're celebrating it. 

Leftists do this with diversity (both a benefit and punishment for the sin of racism), the Christians do this with forced baptisms, Stalinists do this with kulaks, and atheists do this with massacres of Christians in the Middle East.
