Austromarxism is a theoretical current of Marxism that advocates a blend of social democracy and revolutionary socialism while retaining the conception of nationality (interestingly, abstracted from territorial conceptions: see [[concepts.marxism.national-personal-autonomy]]).

Prominent figures associated with it include [[people.otto-bauer]], [[people.rudolf-hilferding]], and [[people.max-adler]].
