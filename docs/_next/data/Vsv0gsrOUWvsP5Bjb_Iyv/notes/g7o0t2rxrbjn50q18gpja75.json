There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, 'I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away.' To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: 'If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although cited in the context of defending Catholicism against reform, the term has other applications (software engineers, for instance, love it).</p>\n<p>This term has value, and many reformers <em>do not</em> understand the things they rail against. However, I often find that this term is used by traditionalists to <a title=\"Private\" href=\"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"private\">Conservatives often defend tradition without reference to results (Private)</a>. If you think you understand the use of something, but want to reform it, you don't truly understand the utility of the thing â€” and therefore, as with so many things, the principle becomes <a title=\"Private\" href=\"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"private\">Disputes over true interpretation can never be meaningfully settled (Private)</a>.
