<p>The iron law of wages is <a href="/notes/06rotpcmi6f1ncazdqqol1c">Lassalle's</a> proposal that wages always tend towards the minimum amount necessary to "sustain the life of the worker". It may have originally started with Turgot, though, according to Schumpeter, and was definitely anticipated by Ricardo and Malthus.</p>
<p><a href="/notes/s1xq7sgsba4quzwefv6h3kz">Karl Marx</a> criticizes this notion in <a href="/notes/oqjtx9vr2wc2jqr0fcvizme">Critique of the Gotha Program</a>.</p>
