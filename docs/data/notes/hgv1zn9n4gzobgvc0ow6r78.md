[[hegel]] conceives of an idealized history of how two people originally meet, finding that each person views one another as an inessential object rather than an equivalent subject. Each person becomes aware of themselves *as individuals* with different wills, creating a tension between the concept of self and other.

The self desires to assert its own will, but in doing so, it must eliminate the will of the other person, causing struggle; if one wins, he becomes the master, and the other the slave. In his victory, the master does not attain true self-consciousness (literally, knowledge of one's own consciousness *qua* object]]), and cannot engage in true self-reflection. In his defeat, the **slave** achieves self-consciousness, however, seeing both his own consciousness and that of his master.

In this way, although beaten, the slave masters both the material world through service of a master ([[slave-societies-weaken-masters]]) and becomes self-conscious, eventually overtaking the master.
