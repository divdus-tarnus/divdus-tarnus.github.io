<p>An <em>unprincipled exception</em> is an exception to ideology made on the basis of necessity. The term was coined by Laurence Auster to refer to the liberal tendency to make specific exceptions to their views on race, gender, and IQ when they need to (i.e. denying that toxic white males are necessary to keep the machines running and then choosing to live in white, gated compounds).</p>
