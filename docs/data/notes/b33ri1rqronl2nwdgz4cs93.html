<p>Managerialism is <a href="/notes/txeuhmj9btt7eeacpabbwlc">James Burnham's</a> term to refer to the form of government adopted in the early 1900s by the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, and the USA (to a lesser extent), replacing both capitalism and Lenin's attempt at socialism. To Burnham, each country had created a bureaucratic, technocratic class that was increasingly taking over the economy and displacing the previous ruling elite.</p>
<p>This formulation, to Burnham, explains the tendencies of each nation better than their nominal form. While each of these nations maintained a public visage of ideological support for what preceded it, the actual practice in each case tended to be remarkably similar â€” the <a href="/notes/1u199zpdox1kdlr6st920rh">nomenklatura</a> in the USSR, the rule of the Party in Nazi Germany, and the <a href="/notes/391u2mv3s0ofjqrfokyxmr2">Brain Trust</a> in the United States.</p>
