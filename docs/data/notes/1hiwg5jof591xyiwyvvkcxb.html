<p>Bioleninism is a biological adaptation of <a href="/notes/4h6h90hm6708v2etjoiscli">Lenin's</a> practice of building the Communist Party from social outsiders and people who would not have flourished under the old bourgeois-aristocratic regime. Where this took the form of recruitment from the proletariat, peasants, Jews, and other nationalities, the modern Left in the West draws its coalition from fringe minority groups <em>biologically</em> distinct from its traditionally white male elite.</p>
<p>Members of these groups (women, blacks, gays, transsexuals) can be trusted to permanently and totally support the regime because they have no chance of survival outside of it. Some even acknowledge this (as a <a href="/notes/eo7n0lry2hcetptyisbv35b">good thing</a>, naturally).</p>
<p>Interestingly, another parallel to contemporary Western societies: <a href="/notes/fkusp3682hzy1zx5e85eb9o">The Bolsheviks were predominantly disaffected nobles</a>, just as <a href="/notes/2k85k7eazmuf9m4754sovaf">The New Left's seizure of power was essentially a self-coup</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>While this is obviously a useful term to refer to the present coalition of the Left, this is not a new phenomenon (<a href="/notes/bnvk8d353lvc9q8766uzgqx">Power recruits from the fringes to ensure loyalty</a>). Interestingly, although the term dates back to <a href="/notes/m5xsf9gy2zgoixdvbv7ypve">Spandrell</a> in popular conception, it appears that Hitler was one of the first, if not the first outright, to <a href="/notes/1tag6uilie0l8qk8t6i16iv">Bioleninism was Hitler's invention</a>.</p>
