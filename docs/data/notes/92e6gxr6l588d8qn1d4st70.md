[[people.de-jouvenel]] sees the development and centralization of power in modernity as being broken into three parts:

- the **center**, or some shared locus of attention that society is focused around
- the **institutions**, or subsidiary systems of power and social authority that coalesce around the center
- the **periphery**, or those governed by the center
