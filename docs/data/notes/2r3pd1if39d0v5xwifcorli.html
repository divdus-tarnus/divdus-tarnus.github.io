<p><a href="/notes/78h895oa6ws5iaemh1entm3">Ian Wright</a> conceives of capital as a <em>literal entity</em>, a dark Lovecraftian god that is brought into being through alienation of labor. Extraction of surplus value and reduction of all items in a society exchange-value, as both occur under the capitalist mode of production, summons a kind of occult entity that requires that all within society be sacrificed to itself.</p>
<p>Capitalism is a kind of necromancy that creates a negative feedback loop where profit is reinvested in new and greater forms, reducing all within society to itself through abstraction of value.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The value form, the titanic abstraction that permeates every aspect of our lives is, in a sense, the primitive language of the controller. It sees and judges our activities in terms of abstract value, by comparing differential profit-rates across its portfolio. But it also commands our activities using abstract value, by injecting and withdrawing its substantial being, which is money. Capital works to mould, shape, and discipline the total labour-power of society into the specific form of abstract labour, which is labour that gives itself up, utterly and completely, as tribute to capital.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The concept is more than a little self-masturbatory, as with most Lovecraftian horror.</p>
