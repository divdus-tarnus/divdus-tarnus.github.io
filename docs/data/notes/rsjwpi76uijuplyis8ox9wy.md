Two-stage theory refers to the belief that all nations must necessarily proceed through a stage of capitalist control over the nation before the [[concepts.marxism.dictatorship-of-the-proletariat]] can arise.

Marx's early works such as the [[books.marx.communist-manifesto]] emphasize this tendency, and many Marxists and non-Marxists believe Marx held this to be a law of history. However, two letters of Marx's indicate some nuance to this belief:

1. Marx's oft-cited [[Marx's letter to Mikhailovsky|articles.marx.letter-to-mikhailovsky]] from the 1870s indicates that he believes a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie *before* the proletariat to be a historically necessary outcome for nations which develop a numerically meaningful proletariat, but that this does not necessarily hold for *every nation whatsoever*.
2. In 1882, [[articles.marx.letter-to-zasulich]] indicated that he believed that Russia could proceed into socialism without first passing through the same "process of dissolution" that occurred in the West on the model of the [[concepts.ussr.obshchina]].
