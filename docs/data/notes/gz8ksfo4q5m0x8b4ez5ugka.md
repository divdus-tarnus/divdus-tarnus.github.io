Pelagianism is a Christian theological position holding that original sin did not taint man's nature irrevocably, and that man has free will to achieve human perfection *through divine grace*. It was largely defined through [[Augustine's|people.augustine]] polemics against it, and was a heresy from the [[religion.christianity.councils.carthage]] onwards.

Pelagianism parallels Judaism in its belief that man can attain divine grace through following God's law, which was intended for man to be able to obey, and accusations of Pelagianism traditionally accompanied accusations of [[Judaizing|religion.christianity.heresies.judaizers]].
