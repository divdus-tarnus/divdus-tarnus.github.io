<p>The concept of uneven and combined development is meant to explain how different countries can have different results and rates of development, and concretely in the case of Russia, how Russia might be able to proceed to a dictatorship of the proletariat without first passing through a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie as the  <a href="/notes/rsjwpi76uijuplyis8ox9wy">stagists</a>believed. A militant, politically developed working class could, by this conception, exist in a backwards society, and would possess revolutionary potential (<a href="/notes/b0xklq1wgv9za0ibhru99n5">Who Has Revolutionary Potential in Marxism?</a>)</p>
<p>Trotskyists view this as a refutation of the belief in <a href="/notes/ow2w3nsor6b3160g7ajmzgi">Socialism in One Country</a>, particularly in a more backwards nation like Russia.</p>
