Historicism attempts to explain things by reference to how they come about (their history and justification).

[[Karl Popper|people.karl-popper]] was a particularly strong critic of this as a philosophy of history â€” of attempting to explain history as a linear process culminating in some particular ideal, as in [[concepts.hegel's-conception-of-history]].
