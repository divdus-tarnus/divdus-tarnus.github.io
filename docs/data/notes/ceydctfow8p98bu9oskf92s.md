I swear to God that I will do the following for the next two weeks, starting [[2022-06-11]]:

- Shower (**get in the shower fully naked with the water on**)
- Not eat grains (rice, corn, wheat) or bread (excepting boba in a sugar-free drink)
- Not eat sweets (small portion of fruit a day acceptable, no mangoes or sugary snacks) outside of cheat days on Saturday
- Eat only during 12:00-1:00 and 5:00-6:00 except for extenuating circumstances like a meal not being ready, and then I will narrow the consumption to within an hour of that if so
- **Track my food every day using a fitness app**
- **Close my move and exercise rings every day**
- **Avoid playing video games for longer than two hours a day on weekdays and longer than six hours on weekends**
- ***Write and finish a Substack article in the next month***
- **Upload five permanent notes to Obsidian with 200 words each every day**
- Read 500 pages total daily
- **Use LingQ and/or Anki to study ten words a day**
