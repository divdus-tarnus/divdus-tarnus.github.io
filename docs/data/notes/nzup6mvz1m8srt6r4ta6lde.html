<p>The concept of the permanent revolution, in Trotskyist thought, is an attempt to explain how socialist revolution can occur in comparatively undeveloped nations (such as Russia was in 1917). </p>
<p>To Trotsky, socialist revolution can begin in a single nation, but if the revolution only occurs in a backwards country like Russia (with an undeveloped working class and hostile enemies both within and without), the revolution will not be successful in the long term, but will degenerate and regress back into capitalism or feudalism.</p>
<p>The term <em>permanent revolution</em> itself refers to two aspects: first, the fact that democracy would necessarily need to occur through <em>proletarian</em> revolution, not through bourgeois revolution (and thus, the proletariat would need to uncompromisingly push for its own power, rather than for the <a href="/notes/rsjwpi76uijuplyis8ox9wy">two-stage theory</a> advocated by the Social Democrats), and second, the fact that each stage of societal transformation under proletarian revolution would continue to develop and fuel further transformations, never allowing society to rest or stagnate.</p>
