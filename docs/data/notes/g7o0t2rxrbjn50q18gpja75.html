<p><em>Chesterton's fence</em> is a principle that states that reforms should not be made to something until one can adequately explain why the thing exists to begin with.</p>
<p>From <em>The Thing: Why I Am a Catholic</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, 'I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away.' To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: 'If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.'</p>

<p>Although cited in the context of defending Catholicism against reform, the term has other applications (software engineers, for instance, love it).</p>
<p>This term has value, and many reformers <em>do not</em> understand the things they rail against. However, I often find that this term is used by traditionalists to <a title="Private" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank" class="private">Conservatives often defend tradition without reference to results (Private)</a>. If you think you understand the use of something, but want to reform it, you don't truly understand the utility of the thing â€” and therefore, as with so many things, the principle becomes <a title="Private" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank" class="private">Disputes over true interpretation can never be meaningfully settled (Private)</a>. Not that that's what <a href="/notes/a7mjhrpnd39etw6ktfs5rir">G. K. Chesterton</a> is saying here.</p>
