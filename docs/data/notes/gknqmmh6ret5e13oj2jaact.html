<p><em>eternal recurrence</em> (ewige Wiederkunft) in <a href="/notes/hvklbfxmwbabhr9iimdh0a6">Nietzsche's</a> thought seems to amount to the desire to live life in such a way that every moment, good and bad, is to be loved (cf. <a href="/notes/z9pr7n9olin7u0mltnwf2pa">Amor Fati</a>)</p>
<p>From <a href="/notes/h5idqmgf501vemcd3cd700p">The Gay Science</a>, as a thought experiment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness, and say to you, "This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence ... Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: "You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and <a href="/notes/3ml1hwky3fthrhebgkum2ug">Also Sprach Zarathustra</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in things; then I shall be one of those who makes things beautiful. <em>Amor fati</em>: let that be my love henceforth! I do not want to wage war against what is ugly. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse those who accuse. <em>Looking away</em> shall be my only negation. And all in all and on the whole: some day I wish to be only a Yes-sayer."</p>
