<ul>
<li>Right of recall</li>
<li>No officials were to receive a wage higher than that of a skilled worker</li>
<li>No standing army and no police force, but armed populace</li>
<li>Administrative tasks should be able to be done by all</li>
</ul>
<p>Lenin's direct quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this connection, the following measures of the Commune, emphasised by Marx, are particularly noteworthy: the abolition of all representation allowances, and of all monetary privileges to officials, the reduction of the remuneration of all servants of the state to the level of ‘workmen’s wages’.</p>
