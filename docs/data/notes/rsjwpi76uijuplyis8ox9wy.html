<p>Two-stage theory refers to the belief that all nations must necessarily proceed through a stage of capitalist control over the nation before the <a href="/notes/0dlkdmbua1rela3ko8h5jgt">Dictatorship of the Proletariat</a> can arise.</p>
<p>Marx's early works such as the <a href="/notes/s6xxvz2fq2arfin45k9m7jo">Communist Manifesto</a> emphasize this tendency, and many Marxists and non-Marxists believe Marx held this to be a law of history. However, two letters of Marx's indicate some nuance to this belief:</p>
<ol>
<li>Marx's oft-cited <a href="/notes/7ar1eyz7u7gj322193ad0vq">Marx's letter to Mikhailovsky</a> from the 1870s indicates that he believes a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie <em>before</em> the proletariat to be a historically necessary outcome for nations which develop a numerically meaningful proletariat, but that this does not necessarily hold for <em>every nation whatsoever</em>.</li>
<li>In 1882, <a href="/notes/jia68tqq7n65ha0vf8tcbta">Letter to Zasulich</a> indicated that he believed that Russia could proceed into socialism without first passing through the same "process of dissolution" that occurred in the West on the model of the <a href="/notes/ecwt95um903ij6j4ns5qvfg">obshchina</a>.</li>
