<p>Holy opportunism is a personal coinage for a phenomenon I observe where ideology and personal interest tend to mutually reinforce one another, and where a person can be both a genuine believer in the core tenets of their system while having that system's tenets transform to match one's interests.</p>
<p>This may just be an overly complex formation of the term ideology; I'm not sure. What I know is that I observe many politicians and thinkers who seem to be both genuine believers in their ideology (<a href="/notes/wjlfmyurd6jihbf9sw95jsa">Hillary Clinton's</a> emails are not at all what you would expect if she dropped her guard immediately behind closed doors, for instance) and yet are incredibly cynical — <a href="/notes/tkvsnnulm11hrhryflfm5c9">LBJ</a>, for instance, is an infamous example of this, and <a href="/notes/94iln59kop4pqigtoju9azh">Caro's book</a> demonstrates him to be both a cynical individual and a genuine believer in civil rights. Why? How wonderful it is when self-interest (see: the voting pattern of African-Americans) tends to coincide with what is morally righteous!</p>
<p>Moldbug has a formulation of this in saying that <a href="/notes/9f2ct8ynh2wofm2rchr11u4">Progressivism allows you to feel good about kicking your enemies</a>, and liberals aren't alone in that regard (<a href="/notes/7ryzsnl6bnbqfc1mfl9fr5v">Ideology allows one to enjoy causing pain to enemies</a>).</p>
