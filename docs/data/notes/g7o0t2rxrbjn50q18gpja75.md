*Chesterton's fence* is a principle that states that reforms should not be made to something until one can adequately explain why the thing exists to begin with.

From *The Thing: Why I Am a Catholic*:

> In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, 'I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away.' To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: 'If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.'

Although cited in the context of defending Catholicism against reform, the term has other applications (software engineers, for instance, love it).

This term has value, and many reformers *do not* understand the things they rail against. However, I often find that this term is used by traditionalists to [[Conservatives often defend tradition without reference to results|defend-tradition-qua-tradition]]. If you think you understand the use of something, but want to reform it, you don't truly understand the utility of the thing â€” and therefore, as with so many things, the principle becomes [[Disputes over true interpretation can never be meaningfully settled|unfalsifiable]]. Not that that's what [[people.g-k-chesterton]] is saying here.
